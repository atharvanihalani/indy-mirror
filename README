TODO
    create pseudocode
        first block is always L-90 (so gotta regenerative mechanism if it's inconsistent)
    ensure maze is solvable
    start code start code start code

    add konami code easter egg??

Questions
    it seems super unwieldy to pass in the main gamepane to every single
    class. am i approaching it wrong? is there a more efficient way to do it?

design choices

    i used a separate child class for each MazeBlock instead of a) interfaces or
    b) making them within a single method
    latter cuz, with constraints array, common methods, etc, made more sense to
    have a distinct class for that. former cuz of more efficient polymorphic code

    the maze is procedurally generated starting from the bottom right cuz a) the
    constraints propagate outwards from there (and b) 'solvability' is more likely
    if I start from the end block??)
