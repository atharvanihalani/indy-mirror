    elaborate on pseudocode for wfc alg
    create pseudocode for player & movements
    create pseudocode for pellets
    start code start code start code



design choices

    i used a separate child class for each MazeBlock instead of a) interfaces or
    b) making them within a single method
    latter cuz, with constraints array, common methods, etc, made more sense to
    have a distinct class for that. former cuz of more efficient polymorphic code

    the maze is procedurally generated starting from the bottom right cuz a) the
    constraints propagate outwards from there (and b) 'solvability' is more likely
    if I start from the end block??)
